$ TITLE "Command Line Options"
The editor can be configured using command line options,
and files can loaded and positioned from the command line.
Options can be placed in environment variables and are
automatically added to the command line each time the
editor is run.

 \b&<name>\n      Include an environment string
 \b#<number>\n    Position cursor to a line
 \b<filename>\n   Load a file
 \b$<filename>\n  Load a file whose name starts with a '@', etc.
$$ \b-r<number>\n   Set number of display rows
$$ \b-c<number>\n   Set number of display columns
$$ \b-M<number>\n   Set video mode
 \b-G<filename>\n Load settings file if not KED.INI
$$ \b-g<filename>\n Load settings file if one is not already loaded
$$ \b-P<filename>\n Set program name
$ PAGE
$ TITLE "Command Line Options"
The environment string \bEDITOR\n is prepended to the command
line, so startup options can be placed in it.  The &<name>
option will include the contents of the named variable at
that point, so you can refer to other strings filled with
options.

You can load multiple files and even position the cursor in
each file, with a command such as

   EDIT readme.doc #12 foo util.doc test.cpp #10

This will load readme.doc, foo, util.doc, and test.cpp, and
position the cursors in two of the files.

$$ TITLE "The -P (Program name) Option"
$$The -P option is needed for versions of DOS prior to 3.0,
$$where the full name of the program is not available to the
$$program.  It is also needed for goofy compilers like Latice
$$6.01 that strips the path from argv\[0].  The argument is an
$$override to the value in argv\[0] which is used by the editor
$$to know the name an directory of its own EXE.  The only thing
$$that uses it now is the help file name, which is taken as the
$$same name as the EXE with an HLP extension.
