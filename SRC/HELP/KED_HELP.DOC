              Command Line Options
 
The editor can be configured using command line options,
and files can loaded and positioned from the command line.
Options can be placed in environment variables and are
automatically added to the command line each time the
editor is run.

 &<name>      Include an environment string
 #<number>    Position cursor to a line
 <filename>   Load a file
 -G<filename> Load settings file if not KED.INI
 
 
 
              Command Line Options
 
The environment string EDITOR is prepended to the command
line, so startup options can be placed in it.  The &<name>
option will include the contents of the named variable at
that point, so you can refer to other strings filled with
options.

You can load multiple files and even position the cursor in
each file, with a command such as

   EDIT readme.doc #12 foo util.doc test.cpp #10

This will load readme.doc, foo, util.doc, and test.cpp, and
position the cursors in two of the files.

              ColorBox Help
 
 All possible color combinations are
 displayed in the ColorBox. The hexadecimal
 equivalent for each color is displayed in
 the color that it represents.

 Use the cursor keys, Home, \bEnd\n, \bPgUp\n,
 or PgDn to move the arrows to the desired
 color. Press Enter to accept it or press
 ESC to abort.
 
 
 
              ColorBox Help
 
 Two arrows surround the color to be selected.
 The flashing arrow points to which hexadecimal
 digit can be entered from the keyboard. For
 example, if the flashing arrow points to the
 high digit, then typing a hex digit will move
 the arrows to the color with that digit in the
 high position. The flashing arrow will then
 point to the low digit. Typing a hex digit now
 will move the arrows to the color that ends
 with that digit.
 
 
 
              Editor Defaults Menu
 
This menu controls the editor defaults
as well as the view defaults that are
inherited by each view.

These are the view defaults:
INSERT_MODE:
  Toggles insert mode on/off.
AUTO-INDENT:
  Toggles auto-indenting on/off.
USE TABS:
  Toggles tabs on/off.
TAB SIZE:
  Change tab width.


 
 
 
              Editor Defaults
 
EXPAND TABS:
  Expand tabs to spaces while loading,
  do nothing with tabs if set to NO.
COMPRESS TABS:
  Compress spaces to tabs while saving,
  do nothing with tabs if set to NO.
WRITE EOF:
  Toggles writing of end-of-file marker.
BACKUP FILES:
  Toggles Auto-backups on/off.
SAFE SAVE:
  Toggle "save save" on/off.
DEFAULT EXTENSION:
  Change default file extension.
PRINTER FILE:
  Filename of printer device.
VIEW_PAGEMODE:
  PageUp/PageDn can either move to
  top/bottom of screen, or new page.
NUMLOCK_SETTING:
  You can automatically have NumLock
  on or off when you start KEd.
QUOTE_PREFIX:
  You can choose up to 3 characters
  to prefix to each line when pasting
  a block. This may be useful when
  replying to a message, and you are
  quoting the original text.
 
 
 
              Insert Mode
 
Toggles insert mode on/off. If insert
mode is off, then overwrite mode is on.



 
 
 
              Auto-indent Mode
 
Toggles auto-indenting on/off. When auto-
ident is on and Enter is pressed, the
cursor is positioned under the first non-
blank character of the above line.

 
 
 
              Use Tabs
 
If toggled on, then pressing TAB will insert enough
spaces to move the cursor to the next tab stop, which
is a multiple of the tab width in TAB SIZE.
If tabs are off, then pressing the tab key will align
the cursor with the next word in the line above.

 
 
 
              Tab Size
 
The tab size is the number of spaces
between each tab stop. The tab size is
ignored if USE TABS is turned off.


 
 
 
              Expand Tabs
 
If toggled on, then files will be loaded
with tab characters expanded into spaces.
If off, then tab chars will show in the
file unexpanded.


 
 
 
              Compress Tabs
 
If toggled on, then files will be saved
with spaces compressed into tabs. If off,
the file is saved with no tabs. 


 
 
 
              Write EOF Marker
 
If toggled on, then all files will be
saved with an EOF (end-of-file) character
appended to the end of the file.


 
 
 
              Backup Files
 
Before saving a file, the editor checks to see if a
file with the same name already exists. If it does,
then it is copied or renamed to the backup directory
(or file spec).

 
 
 
              Safe Save
 
The purpose of the safe save is to ensure that
files are not lost when an error occurs while
writing over an original copy.  The safe save
routine first writes the file to a temporary
filename.  If successful, the file is then
written to the original filename.

 
 
 
              Default Extension
 
This extension is assumed whenever the
file extension is left off of a filename.

 
 
 
              Printer File
 
All printer output is directed to this file.
It should normally be PRN, LPT1, COM1, etc.
Enter a disk filename here if you want to
redirect all printer output to a file.

 
 
 
              Printer Setup String
 
Enter a SETUP string for your printer.
To enter a non-printable character, you
may find it helpful to popup the ASCII
box (Alt-A), to insert the characters.

 
 
 
              View PageMode
 
The editor has 2 versions of the PageUp
and PageDown functions. OFF means move
to top or bottom of screen. ON means move
to the same screen line on next page.

 
 
 
              Numlock Mode
 
You can save your choice of Numlock mode
and automatically have Numlock ON or OFF
when you first start the editor.

 
 
 
              Block Paste Prefix
 
You can choose up to 3 characters to
prefix each line when you Paste a block
of lines. This can be useful if you want
to reply to a mail message and Quote the
original text.

 
 
 
              Active View Settings

              Tab Mode
 
If toggled on, pressing TAB will insert enough
spaces to move the cursor to the next tab stop
