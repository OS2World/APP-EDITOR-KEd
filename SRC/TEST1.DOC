This archive contains KEd v2.10, the current release candidate.
The major new feature is support for movable and sizable windows.
Internally, though, there is a completely new Keyboard input 
system, object-oriented windows, and a new file loading system.
These new internal systems will allow me to expand the functionality
quickly and bring up user defined macros and many other capabilities.
Not implemented at this time are any Wordstar commands and the
often-requested "Microsoft" block commands.
