  This archive contains KEd v2.10, the current release candidate.
  The major new feature is support for movable and sizable windows.
  Internally, though, there is a completely new Keyboard input 
  system, object-oriented windows, and a new file loading system.
  An OS/2 TRAP handler has been implemented, and should allow me
  to find fatal errors faster.
  These new internal systems will allow me to expand the functionality
  quickly and bring up user defined macros and many other capabilities.
