    TITLE  :  DosSetExceptionHandler() vs. _setuserhandler()




            DosSetExceptionHandler()  vs.  _setuserhandler()
            ================================================

       DosSetExceptionHandler() is a function in the OS/2 Control
  Program API that allows OS/2 to register stack based exception
  handling routines.   As a side affect of DosSetExceptionHandler()
  being stack based, an exception that is set via this function
  will only be in affect for the function that it is set in and any
  functions that that setting function calls.   What this means
  that if you call a function to set an exception handler and the
  function returns, at that point the exception handler will no
  longer be valid/used during an exception.

       As a workaround for this limitation of the
  DosSetExceptionHandler(), Borland has introduced a RTL function,
  _setuserhandler(), that can be used anywhere to set exceptions
  handler routines for the duration of the program.  To circumvent
  the limitation of DosSetExceptionHandler(), one should use
  _setuserhandler().
