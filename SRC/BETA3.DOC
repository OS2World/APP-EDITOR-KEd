      This is the third beta of KEd 2.10 (released ver 2.15)
      Fixed bugs:
             keyboard driver (grrrrr)
             "block read" with large files (still a little slow)
             EOF option now reads correctly from the settings file.
             shell command 
             tab support (see on-line help)
      
      For support during testing, I have included 2 versions of the EXE,
      ked.exe and ked_dbg.exe. The dbg version will write out a large
      logfile that tracks each keystroke. If you experience kbd problems
      with the non-debug version, load the dbg version, try to replicate 
      the problem, and email me the logfile.

      Thanks again for your time.

  This is the 2nd beta version of KEd 2.10.
  Fixed bugs:
             keyboard driver (i hope)
             file load dialog

  Not fixed bugs:
             large (>100k) files loaded with "read block" still crash


  Thanks again for your efforts, and I look forward to your findings.
  regards,

  Hi folks!

  This archive contains KEd v2.10, the current release candidate.
  The major new feature is support for movable and sizable windows.
  Internally, though, there is a completely new Keyboard input 
  system, object-oriented windows, and a new file loading system.
  An OS/2 TRAP handler has been implemented, and should allow me
  to find fatal errors faster.
  These new internal systems will allow me to expand the functionality
  quickly and bring up user defined macros and many other capabilities.

  Not implemented at this time are any Wordstar commands and the
  often-requested "Microsoft" block commands.
  It's not clear at this time that those features will be implemented in 
  the final 2.10 release.


  You can enter Size_Window mode with Ctrl-W and Move_Window mode
  with Alt-W. In each case you exit the mode via Esc.


  Some questions:

  Should I provide a "status box" to remind users when they are in this
  mode?

  Should I provide a "Tile Window" capability, either Vertical or Horizontal?


  As usual, this is BETA, and don't use it on irreplacable files.

  I need to know of any anomalies, missing features, or Traps.
  Please do not distribute this version to anyone else without my
  express consent.

  Have fun, and THANKS!

  Don Radick
